    description: "IdealVillage is my first internship in web design and development, which I started in 2019.",
    details: "I received this internship in 2019 to work on some web design and development tasks. I had started learning web design back in 2018, and I used to experiment with CSS and HTML. I was always amazed by how simple color and design changes could completely transform a page - it felt exciting and overwhelming at the same time. That fascination kept me motivated to continue with web design and development. Eventually, I moved on to learning JavaScript, jQuery, Java, C, Python, and more. I worked for about a month, mainly designing a few cards for them. Later, as my college midterms started, the work paused, and I eventually ended the internship.",
